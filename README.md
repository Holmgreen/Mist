# Mist
Intro:
  This is a 2D game in progress inspired by "ForeignGuyMike" and others on youtube which I have gotten the jukebox from and      learned how to implement the engine. 
  The rest I have done by myself purely out of the purpose to understand Java and getting used to the syntax. (Including      music and pictures.)
  The main two worlds are created and most of the mechanics like moving, using spells and going through the two worlds works   properly.

What is left:
  There is no current way to "win" the game, you simply collect orbs and use spells.
  To design the home starting house.
  Saving and loading game.
  When Ooru (main character) talks he should stand still and the shoulders that he is wearing is supposed to be given to him   after he completes the labyrinth without teleporting.
  
Controls:
  I - open inventory
    up, down, left, right - navigate in inventory
    enter - use item in inventory
