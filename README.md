# Mist
Intro:
  This is a Half-done 2D game inspired by "ForeignGuyMike" and others on youtube which I have gotten the jukebox from and      learned how to implement the engine. 
  The rest I have done by myself purely out of the purpose to understanding Java and getting used to the syntax. (Including    music and pictures.)
  The main two worlds are created and most of the mechanics like moving, using spells and going through the two worlds works   properly.

Whats left:
  There is no current way to "win" the game, you simply collect orbs and you cannot do anything with them.
  To design the home starting house.
  Saving and loading game.
  When Ooru (main character) talks he should stand still and the shoulders that he is wearing is supposed to be given to him after he completes the labyrinth without teleporting.
  The shoulders will give him magic powers and will then be able to teleport and use Shadow, his other spell.
