Fixes/Bugs:
	major: moving is bad, because certain directions have priority over others, for example if you press left arrow and then right arrow you will face right but walk left.
		perhaps make it so that the first key that is pressed will always be the facing direction?
		
	elapsed time continues to run (since its connected to the System.currentTimeMillis() function) when the game is paused.
	
	minor: when enemies walk in the same direction that ooru is shooting, it wont aggro. (This only happened when i set the aggroSpeed to 0)
	
	enemies will glitch when collided and have aggro.
	
	items must be able to stack
	
	(fixed?) inventory must be able to have "holes" between items
	
	stacks in inventory
